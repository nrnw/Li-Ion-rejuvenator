#Hybrid vehicle battery charger with automated battery charging and discharging cycles to enhance the battery cell performance. 


Motivation

It is found that Li-Ion batteries in hybrid vehicles will have the memory effect up to some level [1]. Inside a battery pack usually a few of the cells will degrade the performance with usage due to this memory effect. 

Currently these faulty cells were separated from the battery pack and charged discharged using a seperate charger to remove the memory effect. However monitoring of the cell voltages and switching from the discharging  to charging and vise versa is currently done manually.   Ultimate goal of this project is to design a battery charger that can automatically do this process.
